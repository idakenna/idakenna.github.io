	<h2>doll arena</h2>
	<img src="pix/doll-arena.png" title="a short, simple game of playing with a doll that can double jump, in endless space with only platforms to prevent falling forever." alt="my simple red doll figure, a sphere head and square pyramid body with little cylinder legs, stands on a grey platform in a purple and red-hazy sky with a big moon reflecting firy orange, with various out platforms and stairs floating in the sky as well, all different colors.">
	<h3>background</h3>
	<p>just a short assignment using modular prefabs to assemble a scene. I used my doll character, <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/exterior/modular-wooden-bridge-tiles-29501">some bridge pieces</a> and <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/sky/fantasy-skybox-free-18353">a skybox</a> from the Unity Asset Store.</p>
	<p> it runs in browser, so you can play it <a href="https://dustmitegerl.itch.io/doll-arena">right there on my itch page</a>.
	<p>i want to add more dolls - i have <a href="https://youtu.be/Z4M33AyxmdE">a doll that goes splat</a>, and <a href="https://youtu.be/op_kd8WNBOQ">a big doll that screams</a>. i figured i'd make it so the splatting dolls are falling from the sky occasionally and splatting on the platforms, and if the player doll reaches them in time for collision, it gets a point. the big doll also spawns at random, somewhere on the platforms, and if it screams at the player character then the game starts over.</p>
	<h3>genre</h3>
	<p>i suppose this is a platformer? of a sort.</p>
	<h3>special features</h3>
	<p>i use my preferred kind of player controls -- up/down for forward/back, left/right for turning. i allow double-jumping, such that the rigidbody on the player prefab will just keep adding velocity, enabling flying that quickly gets out of control.</p>
	<h3>my role</h3>
	<p>i created the doll prefab and coded everything, and i colored all the bridge pieces, but the pieces themselves and the skybox are borrowed -- click the links above to find them in the Unity Asset Store. many thanks to their creators.</p> 
	<h3>links</h3>
	<p>find the game <a href="https://dustmitegerl.itch.io/doll-arena">on my itch.io</a>.</p>
	<p> i don't currently have it uploaded to my github, but i will get it there soon and add those intended features i discussed above.</p>
