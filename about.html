	<h2>welcome!</h2>
	<p>this is a site i created on 2024-12-09 to organize my portfolio of work created while a student in the University of Baltimore's Bachelors of Science program in Simulation and Game Design, in which i'm on my senior year in the Coding and Development concentration.</p>
	<p>this site is made by me alone. it's entirely static -- just html and css. It's free and opensource -- find the license in the footer at the bottom of the page, and the <a href="https://github.com/idakenna/idakenna.github.io">source code here</a>. Besides html and css, web-wise, i also have experience with php and javascript, and i've undergone a 6 month bootcamp in React-based full stack web development, with java for api and postgresql for relational databasing, and also trained in agile/scrum, restful, and accessible development. but my favorite part of web development is styling -- try selecting some text ^^</p>
	<p>As far as i'm aware, this site meets Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) standards -- AAA for everything except the body text, which meets AA. Sorry if that causes any accessibility issues for you. These color settings are what i use on all my devices to minimize light intensity, as i have sensitivity caused by migraines and fibromyalgia.</p>
